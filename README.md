# Databases-Projects

This project contains the website we made as part of the Databases course, co-created with Giannis Dimoulas. We created the database using MariaDB and then made the connection with the website using Flask. 
The detailed task is shown in the Semester Project pdf. There are a few issues (for example it is prone in some cases to SQL injection, there are certain appearance issues etc) 
but they were not part of the grading criteria and they will be fixed over time. The main goal was the functionality and interconnection of the database, which was achieved adequately.
You can view the detailed pdf of the report, containing the ER diagram, the relational model, the downloading instructions and the user manual, although it is not yet fully translated to Engish.
