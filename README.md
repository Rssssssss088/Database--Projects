# Databases-Projects

This project contains the website we made as part of the Databases course, co-created with Giannis Dimoulas. We created the database using MariaDB and then made the connection with the website using Flask. 
The detailed task is shown in the Semester Project pdf. You can view the detailed pdf of the report, containing the ER diagram, the relational model, the downloading instructions and the user manual, although it is not yet fully translated to Engish.
